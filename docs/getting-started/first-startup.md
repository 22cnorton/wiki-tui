So you've installed wiki-tui, great! (if not, please check the [installation guide](./installation.md)) This page provides an overview of how to use wiki-tui. If you already feel comfortable with the program, check how 
you can configure wiki-tui to your needs.

!!! info
    wiki-tui performs its actions synchronously. That means that you have to wait a few seconds after starting
    the search or opening an article until the window updates. Any keys you press in this wait time will be 
    send after the action finishes

## Startup and CLI

You can start wiki-tui by running the following command from you terminal

```
wiki-tui
```

This will run the program and you can start browsing wikipedia. If you want, 
you can [use the CLI](./using-cli.md) to fasten up your search.

## Start Browsing

Using the TUI and browsing through articles should feel very natural, thanks to
the implementation of some common vim keybindigns, more
[here](./overview-keybindings.md).

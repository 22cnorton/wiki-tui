## Feature requests and implementations

If you have a feature request or improvement suggestion for wiki-tui, there are a few things to keep
in mind. Smaller features or improvements can often be made directly through a pull request, but
bigger features or improvements should be discussed first in an issue. In general, it's better to
open an issue for feature requests and improvements, even if you just want to ask about the
possibility of a certain feature or improvement. Be sure to always check if other requests have been
made for the same feature or improvement before submitting a new one.

You can create a new issue [over here](https://github.com/Builditluc/wiki-tui/issues/new/choose).
Just select the corresponding issue template and fill it out to your best accord.

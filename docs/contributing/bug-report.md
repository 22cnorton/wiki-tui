## Bug and Crash reports

If you have found a bug or experienced a crash while using wiki-tui, we encourage you to file an
issue. When filing a bug or crash report, please make sure to select and fill out
the correct issue template. If you're not sure what to include in your report, take a look at other
bug or crash reports, as well as issues labeled "good first issue," for guidance. If you are still
unsure how to write the report, it's okay to go ahead and submit it anyway. We will be happy to 
help you out and ask for further information as needed. Thank you for helping us improve wiki-tui!

You can create a new issue [over here](https://github.com/Builditluc/wiki-tui/issues/new/choose) and
some good first issues can be found
[here](https://github.com/Builditluc/wiki-tui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc)!

# What can I do with it?

## Search

Search for an article in Wikipedia (by default only the English Wikipedia but that can be changed). The search results feature pagination and a little preview is generated when
you select a result.

## Read

When opening an article wiki-tui generates and displays a table of contents on the right side (which can be disabled) where you can quickly jump to any section in the article.
The main article currently supports links and lists with more features like tables and images planned. Although wiki-tui was designed to be used with a keyboard, it also 
supports mouse input (just click on a link or scroll with your scroll wheel in an article).

## Customize

wiki-tui aims to be highly customizable allowing you to change almost everything to your liking. Currently, customization options include:

- Themes (changing colors of the whole program and individual parts)
- Keybindings (so you don't have to use the arrow keys for navigation)
- Change the behavior of wiki-tui:
    - Disable the table of contents
    - Disable links
    - Disable headers from being rendered
    - Disable lists from being rendered
    - Disable code blocks from being rendered
- Logging
- Change the language of wiki-tui
